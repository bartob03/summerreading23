Clark uses real historical artefacts such as Jim Crow segregation, Georgia, and African-American foklore, to anchor his brisk story about three Black women fighting against evil. While Clark tries to incorporate various elements in this sub-200 page story, it never really bogs down Cordelia, Maryse, and Sadie's uphill and terrifying adventure. The short length allows readers to choose to ignore the social commentary that can be read between the lines, and focus instead in the chilling and rousing events. However, Clark's enthusiasm in his theme can be felt in his characters. Moreover, the evil component never feels superficial, weak, and ephemeral, especially when compared with more popular media from American (e.g. Marvel and DC) and Japan (e.g. manga). The hate from bigots and racists in the story is suffocating and overwhelming, more so than the supernatural creatures that assault the heroic trio. <em>Ring Shout </em>is one of those books that can be finished in one sitting, and yet remain with you for an extra hour or two.</p>\n<h2>Learn more about the author</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Author website</strong>: <a href=\"https://pdjeliclark.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">P.

            "content_html": "<p><em>I Think Our Son is Gay / Uchi no Musuko wa Tabun Gay</em> (2020) is a charming, slice of life manga from Okura. The story revolves around a boy who does not quite understand he is gay and is unsure about how he should respond to this reality. As he navigates simple day-to-day events, this confusion leads him to quite a few humorous situations. Unlike most Western novels, and even American comic books, <em>Uchi no Musuko wa Tabun Gay </em>does not make a big deal about homosexuality at all.  The five volume series is light-hearted and there is no real conflict in the series. His budding homosexuality is a characteristic rather than a problem or issue. High school student Hiroki is familiar to anyone who has spent some time in a typical high school environment. Those not familiar with the Asian/Japanese setting, or manga in general, might have problems relating to the relationships within the Aoyama home or at his public school. Nevertheless, the laugh-out-loud dialogue and the semi-awkward events that occur between Hiroki, his brother Yuri, his loving mom Tomoko, and other supporting characters make the books a pleasant read. Unlike other manga and anime characters, Hiroki is a truly likable character as he deals with his attraction to boys - there is no exaggerated caricatures or superfluous features to Hiroki as often seen in Japanese media.</p>\n<p>Okura's art and script is wonderfully restrained with the facial expressions and reactions of his characters familiar, clear, and warm.  The volumes are a rare treat that deserve a second or even third or fourth reading.</p>\n<h2>Learn more about the author</h2>\n<ul>\n<li id=\"page_header\" class=\"same-width-as-main\"><em><a href=\"https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2021-10-25/author-i-think-our-son-is-gay-manga-will-not-end-in-4th-volume/.178817\">Author: I Think Our Son Is Gay Manga Will Not End in 4th Volume</a></em></li>\n<li><strong>Publisher site</strong>: <a href=\"https://press.na.square-enix.com/Square-Enix-Manga-Books\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Square Enix </a></li>\n<li><strong>Publisher site</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/series/IT1/i-think-our-son-is-gay\">Penguin Random House</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Previews</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>HaroxHaro describes a panel from <em>I Think Our Son is Gay </em>(YouTube).</li>\n</ul>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fWL4gqaMbEE\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>\n<ul>\n<li>Penguin Random House <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/715303/i-think-our-son-is-gay-04-by-okura/\">page previews for Volume 4</a>.</li>\n<li>Penguin Random House <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/697144/i-think-our-son-is-gay-03-by-okura/\">page previews for Volume 3</a>.</li>\n<li>Penguin Random House <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/688203/i-think-our-son-is-gay-02-by-okura/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">page previews for Volume 2</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Reviews</h2>\n<p>Librarian Jesse reviews <em>I Think Our Son is Gay </em>(YouTube).</p>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aJJLfY2dxN8\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>\n<h2>APA entry</h2>\n<p>Okura.

            "content_html": "<p><em>Mexican Gothic</em> by Silvia Moreno-Garcia starts simply enough as impulsive protagonist Noemi Taboada finds herself visiting her ailing newlywed cousin in a Mexican pueblo at the request of her father. With every intention of comforting her cousin, Noemi stays at the High Palace longer than needed and begins to experience disturbing dreams. The behavior of her cousin's new husband, the daunting aunt, the patriarch of the home, and the youngest child at High Palace, seems to signal danger not only to her cousin, but to herself as well. It is obvious to Noemi, however, that secrets abound at High Palace, though she is ultimately unsure if it is her duty to uncover them. </p>\n<p>Moreno-Garcia builds the horrific atmosphere slowly, somewhat dispensing with typical Gothic tropes while ensuring the reader is aware of them at the same time. As Noemi finds herself taking on more than what she expected, the reader realizes the novel is more than just about the travails of a plucky 21-year old, but also about abuse, misogynism, and racism. Although the novel has a modern 1950s setting, Noemi's cushy background and the more depressed circumstances of her cousin's new family calls back classic horror stories of high-born/posh protagonists trapped in an unfriendly and unfamiliar medieval locale.</p>\n<h2>Learn more about the author</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Author website</strong>: <a href=\"https://silviamoreno-garcia.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://silviamoreno-garcia.com/</a></li>\n<li>Books Connect Us podcast: Silvia Moreno-Garcia (YouTube)</li>\n</ul>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cGJulREPGF8\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>\n<h2>Excerpts, audio readings, and sample pages</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.eu/d/2RbSiCz \" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Audible and Kindle excerpts</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.google.nl/books/edition/Mexican_Gothic/ksKyDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Google Books preview</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Reviews</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.thisishorror.co.uk/book-review-mexican-gothic-by-silvia-moreno-garcia/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">This is Horror UK review</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/what-to-read/mexican-gothic-silvia-moreno-garcia-review-deliciously-horrid/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Telegraph review</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>APA reference</h2>\n<p>Moreno-Garcia, S.

            "content_html": "<p><em>Homicide and Halo-Halo</em>, despite its title, is mostly a romance/slice-of-life story with some crime/mystery elements. This book is part 2 of the Tita Rosie's Kitchen Mysteries series. In this iteration, a murder occurs during a beauty pageant, and former winner and amateur sleuth Lila decides to distract herself from her personal life by attempting to solve the mystery. Manansla weaves in and out a colorful cast of characters and keeps the dialogue and pacing breezy and light. As with other books in the series, Filipino food recipes are included. <em>Homicide and Halo-Halo </em>isn't a serious whodunit but a quick and entertaining read at best. While Lila's ethnic background and quirky attitude makes her a likable protagonist, readers might want to pick up the first book,<em> Arsenic and Adobo</em>, to fully appreciate the character as this book also has her dealing with PTSD from that adventure.  </p>\n<h2>Learn more about the author</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Author website:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.miapmanansala.com/\">https://www.miapmanansala.com/</a></li>\n<li><span data-qa=\"headline-text\"><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/books/2022/10/04/mia-manansala-mysery-novels/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The Washington Post: Mia P.

The story revolves around Shawn Mathews, an African-American ex-convict, and Grace Park, a Korean-American immigrant, as they come to grips with generational racial tensions after the death of Mathews' sister and after Grace's mother survives a shooting. Shawn's family is haunted by horrible memories of his sister's death and with the release of Ray from prison, Shawn is wondering if history may repeat itself. Meanwhile, Grace's attempts to reconcile her sister and mother are stymied by elements from the family's past, which continues to be a dagger over their heads in the present.</p>\n<p>Steph Cha strengthens the familial conflict by using minute details from police procedures, media coverage practices, and real-live events. While \"Your House Will Pay\" is fictional, it is deeply anchored in the reality of racism, grief, anger, and violence. In Cha's novel, Los Angeles becomes a stage for tragedy and trauma. </p>\n<h2>Learn more about the author</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/10/30/773224075/embers-of-unrest-in-early-90s-los-angeles-reignite-in-your-house-will-pay\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NPR.org interview: Racial Unrest Of Early '90s Los Angeles Resurfaces In 'Your House Will Pay'</a> </li>\n<li><strong>Author website</strong>: <a href=\"http://stephcha.com/\">Steph Cha – Author Website</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/live/dK9Y-RlMDlM?feature=share\">LA Public Library - A Conversation with Author Steph Cha on Race Relations</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/aZo0FTbe3k4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">KBS World Radio - Steph Cha</a></li>\n<li>National Centre for Writing - Steph Cha </li>\n</ul>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ilW3mf4vWf8\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>\n<h2>Reviews</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/steph-cha/your-house-will-pay/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kirkus review - Your House Will Pay</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/books/story/2019-10-11/steph-cha-your-house-will-pay\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">LA Times Review</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>APA reference</h2>\n<p>Cha, S.

            "content_html": "<p>Even if you aren't familiar with David Bowie's music, Reinhard Kleist's \"<em>Starman: Bowie's Stardust Years</em>,\" originally published in German and available in English, gives you an insight as to how influential Bowie's music, career, and persona were to European, British, and American culture. In <em>Starman, </em>Bowie never flauts his gender fluidity, but is depicted as a musician unashamed of his authentic persona and bombastic presence.  Kleist illustrates Bowie's seminal years with verve and enthusiasm, his colors reflecting Bowie's evolution and growth as an artist and celebrity. <em>Starman</em> isn't an illustrated biography of the revered musician, but rather a homage to his global image and accomplishments. Kleist makes use of various sources such as interviews, news articles, and performances to chart the chaotic rise of David Bowie. His panels and color palette pay respect to 50s and 60s UK comic books, while never deviating from his \"Stardust years\" (a follow up graphic novel will take up his \"Berlin years\").   The 1960s was a lifetime ago and there is no doubt that today's generation of readers may not quite appreciate Kleist's rough and unfamiliar depiction of the period. The occasionally disturbing rock n'roll lifestyle of the time may elicit mixed emotions, but no one who reads \"<em>Starman: Bowie's Stardust Years\" </em>can deny that a graphic novel is a good medium for an authentic depiction of a real and explosive legend such as David Bowie.  </p>\n<h2>Learn more about the author</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Author site</strong>: <a href=\"http://www.reinhard-kleist.de\">www.reinhard-kleist.de</a></li>\n<li><strong>Publisher website</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.selfmadehero.com/books/starman-bowie-s-stardust-years\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.selfmadehero.com/books/starman-bowie-s-stardust-years</a> </li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"style-scope ytd-watch-metadata\"><em>Reinhard Kleist über Starman - David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust Years Teil 2 </em>interview (German) (YouTube).</li>\n</ul>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Mxsi_qVFFM\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>\n<h2>Reviews</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://paperphoenixink.com/2023/03/28/review-reinhard-kleists-starman-bowies-stardust-years/\">Paper Phoenix review</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.buzzmag.co.uk/david-bowie-stardust-years-graphic-novel-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Buzz UK</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Excerpts, audio readings, and sample pages</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.kobo.com/nl/en/ebook/starman-14\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kobo page previews</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.eu/d/bGHjSLP\">Amazon page previews</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>APA reference</h2>\n<p>Kleist, R.
