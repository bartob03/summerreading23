            "content_html": "<p><em>Ring Shout</em> (2020) is a mix of horror, adventure, and science fiction, with monsters in both human (Klans) and inhuman (Ku Kluxes) forms. Clark uses real historical artefacts such as Jim Crow segregation, Georgia, and African-American foklore, to anchor his brisk story about three Black women fighting against evil. While Clark tries to incorporate various elements in this sub-200 page story, it never really bogs down Cordelia, Maryse, and Sadie's uphill and terrifying adventure. The short length allows readers to choose to ignore the social commentary that can be read between the lines, and focus instead in the chilling and rousing events. However, Clark's enthusiasm in his theme can be felt in his characters. Moreover, the evil component never feels superficial, weak, and ephemeral, especially when compared with more popular media from American (e.g. Marvel and DC) and Japan (e.g. manga). The hate from bigots and racists in the story is suffocating and overwhelming, more so than the supernatural creatures that assault the heroic trio. <em>Ring Shout </em>is one of those books that can be finished in one sitting, and yet remain with you for an extra hour or two.</p>\n<h2>Learn more about the author</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://pdjeliclark.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">P.

            "content_html": "<p><em>I Think Our Son is Gay / Uchi no Musuko wa Tabun Gay</em> (2020) is a charming, slice of life manga from Okura. The story revolves around a boy who does not quite understand he is gay and is unsure about how he should respond to this reality. As he navigates simple day-to-day events, this confusion leads him to quite a few humorous situations. Unlike most Western novels, and even American comic books, <em>Uchi no Musuko wa Tabun Gay </em>does not make a big deal about homosexuality at all.  The five volume series is light-hearted and there is no real conflict in the series. His budding homosexuality is a characteristic rather than a problem or issue. High school student Hiroki is familiar to anyone who has spent some time in a typical high school environment. Those not familiar with the Asian/Japanese setting, or manga in general, might have problems relating to the relationships within the Aoyama home or at his public school. Nevertheless, the laugh-out-loud dialogue and the semi-awkward events that occur between Hiroki, his brother Yuri, his loving mom Tomoko, and other supporting characters make the books a pleasant read. Unlike other manga and anime characters, Hiroki is a truly likable character as he deals with his attraction to boys - there is no exaggerated caricatures or superfluous features to Hiroki as often seen in Japanese media.</p>\n<p>Okura's art and script is wonderfully restrained with the facial expressions and reactions of his characters familiar, clear, and warm.  The volumes are a rare treat that deserve a second or even third or fourth reading.</p>\n<h2>Learn more about the author</h2>\n<ul>\n<li id=\"page_header\" class=\"same-width-as-main\"><em><a href=\"https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2021-10-25/author-i-think-our-son-is-gay-manga-will-not-end-in-4th-volume/.178817\">Author: I Think Our Son Is Gay Manga Will Not End in 4th Volume</a></em></li>\n<li>Publisher site: <a href=\"https://press.na.square-enix.com/Square-Enix-Manga-Books\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Square Enix </a></li>\n<li>Publisher site: <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/series/IT1/i-think-our-son-is-gay\">Penguin Random House</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Previews</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>HaroxHaro describes a panel from <em>I Think Our Son is Gay</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fWL4gqaMbEE\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>\n<ul>\n<li>Penguin Random House <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/715303/i-think-our-son-is-gay-04-by-okura/\">page previews for Volume 4</a>.</li>\n<li>Penguin Random House <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/697144/i-think-our-son-is-gay-03-by-okura/\">page previews for Volume 3</a>.</li>\n<li>Penguin Random House <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/688203/i-think-our-son-is-gay-02-by-okura/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">page previews for Volume 2</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Reviews</h2>\n<p>Librarian Jesse reviews <em>I Think Our Son is Gay.</em></p>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aJJLfY2dxN8\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>\n<h2>APA entry</h2>\n<p>Okura.

            "content_html": "<p>Even if you aren't familiar with David Bowie's music, Reinhard Kleist's \"<em>Starman: Bowie's Stardust Years</em>,\" originally published in German and available in English, gives you an insight as to how influential Bowie's music, career, and persona were to European, British, and American culture. In <em>Starman, </em>Bowie never flauts his gender fluidity, but is depicted as a musician unashamed of his authentic persona and bombastic presence.  Kleist illustrates Bowie's seminal years with verve and enthusiasm, his colors reflecting Bowie's evolution and growth as an artist and celebrity. <em>Starman</em> isn't an illustrated biography of the revered musician, but rather a homage to his global image and accomplishments. Kleist makes use of various sources such as interviews, news articles, and performances to chart the chaotic rise of David Bowie. His panels and color palette pay respect to 50s and 60s UK comic books, while never deviating from his \"Stardust years\" (a follow up graphic novel will take up his \"Berlin years\").   The 1960s was a lifetime ago and there is no doubt that today's generation of readers may not quite appreciate Kleist's rough and unfamiliar depiction of the period. The occasionally disturbing rock n'roll lifestyle of the time may elicit mixed emotions, but no one who reads \"<em>Starman: Bowie's Stardust Years\" </em>can deny that a graphic novel is a good medium for an authentic depiction of a real and explosive legend such as David Bowie.  </p>\n<h2>Learn more about the author</h2>\n<p><strong>Author site</strong>: <a href=\"http://www.reinhard-kleist.de\">www.reinhard-kleist.de</a></p>\n<p><strong>Publisher website</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.selfmadehero.com/books/starman-bowie-s-stardust-years\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.selfmadehero.com/books/starman-bowie-s-stardust-years</a></p>\n<h2>Interviews</h2>\n<p><em>Stadtbibliothek Stuttgart</em> interview regarding <em>Starman </em>(German).</p>\n<div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/V4OOPrwbQh8\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div> </p>\n<p class=\"style-scope ytd-watch-metadata\"><em>Reinhard Kleist über Starman - David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust Years Teil 2 </em>interview (German)</p>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Mxsi_qVFFM\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>\n<h2>Reviews</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://paperphoenixink.com/2023/03/28/review-reinhard-kleists-starman-bowies-stardust-years/\">Paper Phoenix review</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.buzzmag.co.uk/david-bowie-stardust-years-graphic-novel-review/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Buzz UK</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Excerpts, audio readings, and sample pages</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.kobo.com/nl/en/ebook/starman-14\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kobo page previews</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://amzn.eu/d/bGHjSLP\">Amazon page previews</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>APA reference</h2>\n<p>Kleist, R.
